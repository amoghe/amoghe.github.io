The solution I found [here](http://blog.karssen.org/2014/05/10/fixing-backlight-control-with-ubuntu-on-my-thinkpad-t440s/) worked for me.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Simply add this to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line in /etc/default/grub:\r\n```\r\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"acpi_backlight=vendor quiet splash\"\r\n```\r\nand run\r\n```\r\nsudo update-grub\r\n```\r\nReboot and you will be able to change the backlight brightness in finer steps.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
